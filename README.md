# Pacmen
## Description
### Add pacmen to the page and watch them move around the screen. This project was designed to show my JS skills using functions and callbacks as well as CSS button design. 
## How to Run
### Open index.html and click 'Add PacMan' as many times as you wish to add pacmen to the screen. Click 'Start Game' to watch them move around the screen and click again to increase their speed.
## Roadmap of Future Improvements
### Future improvements include adding different images other than pacmen for personalized fun.
